# AI-4D-TicTacToe
Created: October 4, 2018

Description:
This program contains an artificial intelligence (AI) which will always make the most optimal move in the game of 4D TicTacToe. 4D TicTacToe is played similar to normal TicTacToe. In 4D TicTacToe there are 3 4x4 grids stacked on top of each other. The objective is to place an X or an O consecutively across on grid or across all the grids. For example, if we placed an X in the top left position of each grid, then we would win. 

The AI itself works by simulating every possible outcome. After simulating all possible outcomes, the AI will choose the move that gives it the most opportunities to win while at the same time giving the player the most opportunities to lose. The program has a menu in which the difficulty of the AI can be set. The AI can be set to look 0-3 moves ahead. After a move has been made, a display will show an updated version of the 4D TicTacToe board.
